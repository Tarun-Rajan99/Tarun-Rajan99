## Hi, my name is Tarun ðŸ‘‹

I am currently studying an MSc in Statistics at Imperial.

Previously, I graduated from the London School of Economics.

Some of my favourite modules from my undergraduate were:

- Stochastic Processes
- Probability
- Statistical inference

Here is a link to the [Stochastic Process Module](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar2023-2024/courseGuides/ST/2023_ST302.htm).
